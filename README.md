# CS5002
Data Structures + Discrete Mathematics

This course uses C (not C++). We are given the opportunity to implement ArrayList, LinkedList, Trees, Heaps, Callback Functions, etc with C (pointer, dereferencing). 


Course Description: 
This course is about data structures and their algorithms. Data structures is the study of various ways to represent aggregations of information in ways that model the relationships among the information, and enable the information in the data structures to be efficiently traversed accessed and updated. We will examine various data structures and their uses, including lists, sets, maps, trees,heaps, and graphs.
