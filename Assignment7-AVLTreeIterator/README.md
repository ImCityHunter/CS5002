# Assignment 7
Modify the binary tree iterator from the BinarySearchTree code in lecture 12 or the AVLTree code in lecture 13 to support iterating in reverse order. For in-order traversal, it would first visit the right child, then the parent, then the left child. For post-order, it would first visit the right child, then the left child, then the parent. For pre-order, it would first visit the parent, the the right child, then the left child
