# Assignment 4

Implement a MessagePriorityQueue that is a struct and the functions specified in the "messagepriorityqueue.h" file in the "2018FACS5002SV/assignment-4" repository. Stubs for the functions are in the "messagepriorityqueue.c" source file. The "messagepriorityqueue.h" file also defines a Priority enum. The ordinal values of the priorities indicate the priority, with Highest (0) being the highest and Lowest (3) the lowest.
